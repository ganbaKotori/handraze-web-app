        <p>
          The handraze-web-app repository contains the branches MASTER, DEV,
          DOCUMENTS, GH-PAGES, and PROTOTYPE.
        </p>
        <p>
          To get started, open a folder where you want to clone the repository.
          I have a folder named github in my documents folder that contains all
          of my repositories. Navigate to the destination of the folder on
          gitBash and then enter the command:
        </p>
        <p class="code">
          git clone https://github.com/ganbaKotori/handraze-web-app.git
        </p>
        <p>
          To switch to the DEV branch enter the command:
        </p>
        <p class="code">
          git fetch
        </p>
        <p>Followed by</p>
        <p class="code">git checkout dev</p>
        <p>
          This applies to the branches in the repo. When you are pushing your
          work, MAKE SURE YOU ARE THE CORRECT BRANCH!
        </p>

          Working with Branches
        </h3>
        <p>
          When working on a new feature for Handraze, you need to create a new
          branch with the <b>dev</b> branch as the parent.
          <br />
          To accomplish this, make sure you "git checkout" the dev branch.
          <br />
          Follow this with the command:
        </p>
        <p class="code">git checkout -b feature_branch</p>
        <p>
          feature_branch can be any name related to the feature you are
          developing. This new branch is based off the dev branch. This means
          that all the files from the dev branch are in this new branch.
          <br />
          Once you're done with development in the feature branch, commit and
          push the branch to github.
        </p>
        <p class="code">git add .</p>
        <p class="code">
          git commit -m "enter your message here(don't remove these quotation
          marks)"
        </p>
        <p class="code">git push</p>
        <p>
          Do these 3 git commands above within your feature branch and it should
          show up on gitHub
        </p>
